\title{Quantify alternative splicing events}
\usage{
quantifySplicing(annotation, junctionQuant, eventType = c("SE", "MXE",
  "ALE", "AFE", "A3SS", "A5SS"), minReads = 10, genes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotation}{List of data frames: annotation for each alternative
splicing event type}

\item{junctionQuant}{Data frame: junction quantification}

\item{eventType}{Character: splicing event types to quantify}

\item{minReads}{Integer: discard alternative splicing quantified using a
number of reads below this threshold}

\item{genes}{Character: gene symbols for which the splicing quantification 
of associated splicing events is performed (by default, all splicing events 
undergo splicing quantification)}
}
\value{
Data frame with the quantification of the alternative splicing events
}
\description{
Quantify alternative splicing events
}
\examples{
# Calculate PSI for skipped exon (SE) and mutually exclusive (MXE) events
annot <- readFile("ex_splicing_annotation.RDS")
junctionQuant <- readFile("ex_junctionQuant.RDS")

psi <- quantifySplicing(annot, junctionQuant, eventType=c("SE", "MXE"))
}
