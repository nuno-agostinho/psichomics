# psichomics 1.12.1 (29 January, 2020)

* Alternative splicing events can now be represented via diagrams:
    - Redesign of alternative splicing event selection (graphical interface)
    - `plotSplicingEvent()` plots diagram representation of alternative
    splicing events
    - In the visual interface, alternative splicing event diagrams were added
    below distribution plots (to quickly illustrate higher and lower values of
    alternative splicing quantification) and in annotation page
* User-provided junction quantification loading:
    - Support junction coordinates from mitochondrial, Z and W chromosomes
    - Fix issues with files containing splice junctions within `random`, `alt`
    and `unknown` chromosomes by discarding those rows (a warning is raised)
* Alternative splicing annotation:
    - `listSplicingAnnotations()` can now be filtered by species, assembly and
    data of available annotations
* Improve import/export of data groups from/to a file, including colour support
* Copy-edit and improve all tutorials, welcome message and help tab
* Include link to article in Methods in Molecular Biology:
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0301-7_10

## More bug fixes and minor changes

* TCGA and SRA data loading:
    - `loadFirebrowseData()` now returns expected data when asking for multiple
    datasets (such as in the case of performing a pan-cancer analysis) in both
    visual and command-line interface
    - SRA projects containing only one column of extra information in sample
    metadata are now correctly loaded instead of raising an error
    (`loadSRAproject()`)
* Data loading and manipulation:
    - Copy-edit information on the format of user-provided files
    - Warn when discarding rows with duplicated rownames after loading
    user-provided files
    - `getGtexDataTypes()` is now exported, as expected
    - `parseSplicingEvent()` now returns the coordinates as numeric if 
    `coords = TRUE` and `char = FALSE`
    - Improve dialog when trying to load a local folder without any supported 
    files available
* Alternative splicing annotation:
    - Confirmation dialog is not displayed any more when creating a folder
    (specially useful while running the visual interface)
    - Allow to select cache directory of `AnnotationHub` (command-line
    interface)
    - Fix `prepareGeneQuant()` discarding the argument `strandedness` if
    either `stranded` or `stranded (reverse)`
* Data grouping:
    - Samples not associated with any subject are now kept when exporting groups
    to a file
    - Fix issues related with importing groups based on a file with groups of
    splicing events and/or genes
    - Inform user when groups are successfully loaded from a file and whether
    any group elements are discarded in the process
    - Show number of genes contained in pre-made gene lists
    - Discard unavailable genes when creating group of genes based on pre-made
    gene lists (unless these are automatically created at startup)
* Density plot (`plotDistribution()`):
    - Fix visual bug when plotting a group with only one sample (if one data
    point is available for a group, only the rug plot is drawn)
    - After hiding all plot series, rug plots of the different groups can be 
    distinguished based on the Y axis (different arbitrary Y values are given to
    each rug plot series)
    - Rug plot labels now show data values if sample names are not provided
    - Rug plot labels can now be rotated (rotation is not enabled by default
    given `Highcharts` issues that may occur at different zoom levels and
    depending on proximity between different sample values)
    - Fix misguiding example in function documentation
    - When hovering the values in the rug plot, the colour of the tooltip is now
    the same used for the rug points as expected
* Survival analysis (p-value plot):
    - Fix alternative splicing quantification cutoff being selected based on the
    one whose difference has the highest (instead of the lowest) p-value
    - Fix plot line label presenting "p < 0.05" independently of the threshold 
    used for significance

    - Fix alerts crashing the visual interface
    - Improve message formatting regarding HTML-containing alerts
* Improve unit tests and function documentation

# psichomics 1.10.2 (4 Oct, 2019)

Fix warnings in Windows-specific CI tools and Bioconductor

# psichomics 1.10.1 (19 Sep, 2019)

Avoid timeouts in CI tools and Bioconductor builds by skipping a specific unit
test

# psichomics 1.8.3 (21 April, 2019)

Replace deprecated `R.utils::evalWithTimeout()` with `R.utils::withTimeout()`

# psichomics 1.8.2 (26 March, 2019)

    - By default, data table now only displays at most the first 100 columns 
    for performance reasons
* Alternative splicing quantification:
    - Allow to discard samples before alternative splicing quantification
    - In alternative splicing quantification dataset summary, plot
    quantification based on median, variance and range per splicing event across
    samples to provide tools to filter quantification (`plotRowStats()`)

    - Allow to discard samples before filtering and normalisation
    - Filter low read counts using `edgeR::filterByExpr()`
    - Allow to perform `limma::voom()` on gene expression data (without design

    per sample, distribution of library sizes and gene-wise mean and variance of
    gene expression across samples to provide the user tools to assess gene 
    expression normalisation (`plotGeneExprPerSample()`, `plotDistribution()` 
    and  `plotRowStats()`, respectively)
    - Convert between different gene identifiers (the original identifier is 
    kept in some conditions, read `convertGeneIdentifiers()`); in the visual
    interface, when filtering and normalising gene expression, ENSEMBL 
    identifiers are converted to gene symbols, by default
* Groups:
    - By default, load pre-made lists of genes when loading gene expression or
    loading/performing alternative splicing quantification
    - Added pre-made list of genes that encode for RNA-binding proteins 
    (Sebestyen et al. 2016), useful to postulate about the regulatory role of
    those proteins based on gene expression and PSI correlation analyses
* Correlation analyses:
    - Allow to use groups of genes and alternative splicing events in 
    correlation analyses
    - Plot specific combinations of gene and alternative splicing events 
    (`[.GEandAScorrelation`())

    - Fix progress bar
    - Decrease loading time after quantifying alternative splicing
    - By default, quantify skipped exons, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 
    3' and 5' splice sites, and alternative first and last exons; the default
    option is now consistent across both the visual and command-line interfaces)
* Differential analyses:
    - Allow distribution plots to show the name of the samples when hovering or
    when a rug plot is rendered if `rugLabels = TRUE` (function
    `plotDistribution()`)
    - Fix distribution plots requiring all samples in a group when using 
    function `plotDistribution()`
    - Fix group colours and opacity for rug plot points within the distribution 
    plot (occurred in the command-line version; function `plotDistribution()`)
    - Fix wrong information in the table of differential splicing results (only
    occurs when the first splicing event is one for which there is not enough
    information to calculate statistical tests)
    - Fix inconsistency when presenting median and variance differences between
    gene expression and alternative splicing quantification
    - Fix error when groups contain samples outside the data being analysed

    when plotting -log10(q-values), for instance, where it is now possible to
    highlight values >= -log10(0.05), i.e. q-values <= 0.5, instead of inputting
    an approximate value
* Correlation analyses:
    - Colour samples by group
    - Render contour based on a density estimate
    - Display exportable table with correlation analyses

    - Quantification of alternative first and last exons: following more

* Dimensionality reduction:
    - Change tolerated missing values per event to 5% by default for both PCA
    and ICA (in both visual and command-line interfaces)
    - PCA: In the table that shows the events that most contribute to the

    `diffAnalyses()` and `plotDistribution()` (command-line interface)

    - Fix misleading gene expression (non-)normalisation by converting reads to 
    counts per million (CPM) using `edgeR::cpm()` after normalisation using
