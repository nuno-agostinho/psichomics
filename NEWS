        contextual information for the selected cut-off (below the slider)
        - Improve how alternative splicing quantification is assigned to

        the principal components
    * Survival analysis:
        - Shorten calculation of optimal PSI that minimises the survival
        difference
        - Improve visual cues of optimal PSI cut-off and present p-value of 
        selected PSI cut-off
        - Fix ambiguous error messages
        - Fix incorrect Cox model results for formula-based calculations
        - Fix null Cox models crashing the program
    * Differential splicing analysis:
        - Select sample types for differential splicing analysis
        - Fix statistical tests not displaying for individual events after
        differentially analysing all events using the other statistical tests

====================
    
    * Bug fixes regarding gene annotation:
        - Fix disabled gene selection when choosing a splicing event associated
          with a single gene after selecting an event related to multiple genes
        - Fix display of PubMed articles related to previously selected gene 
          when selecting a single-gene-associated event after selecting an event
          related to multiple genes
    * Bug fixes regarding groups:
        - Fix groups by rows not working
