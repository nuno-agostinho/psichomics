1.0.6 (16 Jan, 2017)
====================

    * Differential splicing analysis:
        - Fix major bug where samples could be placed in the wrong groups
        - Shorten speed of the calculation for the optimal PSI cut-off that 
        minimises the survival difference
        - Fix not performing statistical tests for two selected sample types
        while analysing a single event with three or more sample types
        - Fix differential analysis on one splicing event not working when using
        `diffAnalyses()` function
        - Fix differential analysis not showing for individual events before
        navigating to the page where the analysis is performed for all events
        - Improve readability and information of statistical tests for single
        events
    * Principal component analysis:
        - Shorten time taken to calculate principal components and to render the
        loadings plot
        - Fix loadings plot error when rendering some principal components
    * Survival analysis:
        - Fix incorrect number of patients from the survival groups in the
        contextual information for the selected cut-off (below the slider)
    * Protein annotation:
        - Warn user when trying to render proteins with no domains

1.0.5 (7 Jan, 2017)
===================

    * Navigate history using the browser forward and back buttons
    * Fix delay when displaying large data by removing columns containing 
    missing values exclusively
    * Principal component analysis:
        - Improve speed when calculating total contribution of each variable to
        the principal components
    * Survival analysis:
        - Shorten calculation of optimal PSI that minimises the survival
        difference
        - Improve visual cues of optimal PSI cut-off and present p-value of 
        selected PSI cut-off
        - Fix ambiguous error messages
        - Fix incorrect Cox model results for formula-based calculations
        - Fix null Cox models crashing the program
    * Differential splicing analysis:
        - Select sample types for differential splicing analysis
        - Fix statistical tests not displaying for individual events after
        differentially analysing all events using the other statistical tests

1.0.4 (18 Dec, 2016)
====================

    * Correctly load files and quantify alternative splicing for PRAD, OV and
    PAAD tumour types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
    * Fix session disconnecting when exporting plots in Firefox
    * Improve text and behaviour of fields to select datasets and AS events
    * Fix author names and add contributor

1.0.3 (13 Dec, 2016)
====================
    
    * Bug fixes regarding gene annotation:
        - Fix disabled gene selection when choosing a splicing event associated
          with a single gene after selecting an event related to multiple genes
        - Fix display of PubMed articles related to previously selected gene 
          when selecting a single-gene-associated event after selecting an event
          related to multiple genes
    * Bug fixes regarding groups:
        - Fix groups by rows not working
        - Fix group selection not working when only one group exists
        - Improve argument name of getGroupsFrom()
    * Other minor improvements
