# 1.4.1 (14 Dec, 2017)
* Fixes regarding GTEx data:

    interface

* Update file description and README
* Updated support to properly parse new notation of alternative splicing 
annotation from Bioconductor (backwards compatible with older notation)

# 1.4.0 (22 Oct, 2017)

* Support for loading new GTEx V7 data
* Support gene expression data:
    - Load, filter, normalise and perform log2-transformation on gene expression
    data from TCGA
    - Perform principal component analysis based on gene expression data, 
    survival analysis by gene expression cutoff and pairwise differential 
    gene expression analysis
    - Correlate gene expression of a given gene against PSI values of multiple
    alternative splicing events
* Data loading:
    - Add step-wise instructions about loading of user-owned files
    - Filter GTEx junction quantification based on tissues of interest (all 
    tissues are loaded by default)
    - Quantify splicing based on a list of genes (splicing events within all 
    genes are quantified by default)
    - Parse sample information from TCGA samples using `parseTcgaSampleInfo`
    - Generate TCGA sample metadata when loading TCGA junction quantification
    - Present data summary after loading the data
* Data grouping:
    - Redesigned group creation and selection
    - Create groups based on genes and alternative splicing events
    - Assign a customisable colour per data group
    - Export or import patient and sample identifiers of data groups
    - Add new set operations when grouping (such as complement, subtraction and
    symmetric difference)
    - Suggest attributes of interest when creating groups
    - Allow to retrieve the universe of patient and sample identifiers by
    performing the complement group without any group selected
    - Statistically analyse group independence (useful to assess the overlap 
    between a PCA cluster and groups derived from clinical and sample 
    attributes, for instance)
* Differential analysis:
    - Label points based on top differentially spliced events or genes, selected 
    alternative splicing events and/or selected genes
    - Create AS event and gene groups based on filtered or selected AS events 
    and genes in the tables
* Dimensionality reduction techniques:
    - Subset data based on groups of AS events and genes before performing 
    dimensionality reduction
    - Create data groups based on the partitioning clustering of PCA scores
    - Perform independent component analysis (ICA) on alternative splicing 
    quantification and gene expression data
* Survival analysis:
    - Add p-value plot to visually infer the significance of survival analyses
    based on multiple alternative splicing quantification cutoffs
* Gene, transcript and protein information:
    - Information retrieval is now only dependent on a user-defined gene,
    instead of requiring alternative splicing quantification data to be loaded

    for Homogeneity of Variance is infinite

    chosen for the X and Y axes

    - Improve survival curves based on the optimal alternative splicing
    quantification cutoff:
        - Include the survival curve previews in 3 new columns within the
        differential splicing analyses table, instead of below that table; those
        columns consist of the survival curves, the optimal PSI cutoff and the 
        respective log-rank test's p-value
        - Allow to use survival data when plotting and table sorting
        - Include the optimal PSI cutoff and the respective log-rank test's 
        p-value in exported tables
        - Fix link to survival analyses using the previously calculated PSI
        cutoff
* Principal component analysis:
    - When clicking on a alternative splicing event in the loadings plot, the
    appropriate differential splicing analyses will now be automatically
    rendered with the respective options, as expected
* Survival analysis:
    - Properly set the title of survival curves based on the selected splicing
    event's quantification
    - Improve readability of Cox PH models
    - When performing survival analyses by alternative splicing cutoff, each
    patient is assigned the PSI value from the respective sample; for patients
    with more than one sample, the assigned sample is chosen based on the most
    frequent sample type across all patients (before, the first matched 
    non-normal or non-control samples were used)
