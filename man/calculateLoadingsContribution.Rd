\usage{
calculateLoadingsContribution(pca, pcX = 1, pcY = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{pca}{\code{prcomp} object}

\item{pcX}{Character: name of the X axis of interest from the PCA}

\item{pcY}{Character: name of the Y axis of interest from the PCA}
}
\value{
Data frame containing the correlation between variables and selected 
principal components and the contribution of variables to the selected 
principal components (both individual and total contribution)
}
\description{
Total contribution of a variable is calculated as per: 
((Cx \* Ex) + (Cy \* Ey))/(Ex + Ey), where Cx and Cy are the 
contributions of a variable to principal components (x and y) and Ex and Ey 
are the eigenvalues of principal components (x and y)
