    * Navigate history using the browser forward and back buttons
    * Fix delay when displaying large data by removing columns containing

        - Improve speed when calculating total contribution of each variable to
        the principal components
    * Survival analysis:
        - Shorten calculation of optimal PSI that minimises the survival
        difference
        - Improve visual cues of optimal PSI cut-off and present p-value of 
        selected PSI cut-off
        - Fix ambiguous error messages
        - Fix incorrect Cox model results for formula-based calculations
        - Fix null Cox models crashing the program
    * Differential splicing analysis:
        - Select sample types for differential splicing analysis
        - Fix statistical tests not displaying for individual events after
        differentially analysing all events using the other statistical tests

1.0.4 (18 Dec, 2016)
====================

    * Correctly load files and quantify alternative splicing for PRAD, OV and

    * Improve text and behaviour of fields to select datasets and AS events
    * Fix author names and add contributor

        - Fix display of PubMed articles related to previously selected gene 
          when selecting a single-gene-associated event after selecting an event
          related to multiple genes
    * Bug fixes regarding groups:
        - Fix groups by rows not working
