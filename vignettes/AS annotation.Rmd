The splicing events annotation is different according to the program that
creates it. The programs which allow to quantify expression levels of
alternative splicing events studied in this report are:

* [MISO](https://miso.readthedocs.org/en/fastmiso/)
* [SUPPA](https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/suppa)
* [VAST-TOOLS](https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools)
* [MATS](http://rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net)

It's also important to understand that the splicing events annotation may vary
according to the splicing event type. The most common splicing event types
annotated across the aforementioned programs are described in the following
image (retrieved from the
[SUPPA website](https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/suppa)).

To conciliate the output from the different programs, it was decided to parse
each splicing event ID to a R data type known as list with all the important
attributes of an event, including:

* Species
* Chromosome
* Strand
* Gene
* mRNA
* Splicing event type
* Inclusion level (PSI)

In order to store the events themselves, it's possible to characterise all the
represented splicing event types by using the boundaries of the following 4
exons:

* Upstream constitutive exon (C1)
* Upstram alternative exon (A1)
* Downstream alternative exon (A2)
* Downstream constitutive exon (C2)

The following table describes which positions should be stored to identify each
splicing event type:

Splicing event type        | C1 start | C1 end | A1 start | A1 end | A2 start | A2 end | C2 start | C2 end |
-------------------------- | :------: | :----: | :------: | :----: | :------: | :----: | :------: | :----: |
Exon skipping              |          | •      | •        | •      |          |        | •        |        |
Mutually exclusive exons   |          | •      | •        | •      | •        | •      | •        |        |
Alternative 5' splice site |          | • •    |          |        |          |        | •        |        |
Alternative 3' splice site |          | •      |          |        |          |        | • •      |        |
Retained intron            | •        | •      |          |        |          |        | •        | •      |
Alternative first exon     | •        | •      | •        | •      |          |        | •        |        |
Alternative last exon      |          | •      | •        | •      |          |        | •        | •      | 
Tandem UTR                 |          |        |          |        |          |        | •        | • •    | 

Note there are two glyphs in some cases. That means two alternative positions
are stored (for example, in the case of the alternative 5' splice site, the C1
end can alternatively be one of the two positions).

Before discussing how to parse thousands and thousands of events, we should
reflect a bit on the tools available to compare different solutions that solve
the same problem and how to measure performance on R. You can read about it
in the article [Measuring performance](Measuring performance.Rmd).

Another thing to consider is whether we should be using a list or an object to
store the information pertaining to each event. I'll try to create a list at
first but maybe it would be better to have a class for events. This way, the
attributes would be much clearer to others. But really, would it be that
different if we take into account that the documentation explains the data
structure anyway? And is there any impact in the performance of the same script
using objects instead of lists?
