\title{Test the survival difference between groups of patients}
\usage{
testSurvival(survTerms, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{survTerms}{\code{survTerms} object: survival terms obtained after 
running \code{processSurvTerms} (see examples)}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to \code{survival::survdiff}
\describe{
  \item{subset}{
expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be used in
the fit.  This can be a logical vector (which is replicated to have
length equal to the number of observations), a numeric vector indicating
which observation numbers are to be included (or excluded if negative),
or a character vector of row names to be included.  All observations are
included by default.
}
  \item{na.action}{
a missing-data filter function.  This is applied to the \code{model.frame} after any
subset argument has been used.  Default is \code{options()$na.action}.
}
  \item{rho}{
a scalar parameter that controls the type of test.
}
  \item{timefix}{process times through the \code{aeqSurv} function to
  eliminate potential roundoff issues.}
}}
}
\value{
p-value of the survival difference or \code{NA}
}
\description{
Test the survival difference between groups of patients
}
\note{
Instead of raising errors, an \code{NA} is returned
}
