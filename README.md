[psichomics: graphical application for alternative splicing quantification and analysis][article].
*Nucleic Acids Research*. 47(2), e7.

Interactive R package with an intuitive Shiny-based graphical 
interface for alternative splicing quantification and integrative analyses of
alternative splicing and gene expression based on 
[The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)][TCGA], the 
[Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project][GTEx], 
[Sequence Read Archive (SRA)][SRA] and user-provided data.

*psichomics* interactively performs:
- Dimensionality reduction
- Median- and variance-based differential splicing and gene expression analyses
- Survival analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Grouping by clinical and molecular features (such as tumour stage or survival)
- Genomic mapping and functional annotation of alternative splicing events and genes

## Install and start running

### Bioconductor

To install the package from [Bioconductor][], type the following in [RStudio][]
or in an R console:

```r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("psichomics")
library("psichomics")
```
3. RStudio is now accessible via the web browser at https://localhost:8787
4. Enter RStudio with user `rstudio` and password `bioc`
5. Load psichomics using `library(psichomics)`
6. Start the visual interface of psichomics with `psichomics()`

Start the visual interface of psichomics with `psichomics()`

### GitHub

Install from GitHub (specify a branch or tag via the `ref` argument):

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nuno-agostinho/psichomics", ref="master")
library("psichomics")
```

Start the visual interface of psichomics with `psichomics()`

### Docker

The Docker images are based on [Bioconductor Docker][biocDocker] and contain psichomics and its dependencies.

1. Pull the latest Docker image:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/nuno-agostinho/psichomics:latest
```

2. Start RStudio Web from the Docker image:
```
docker run -e PASSWORD=bioc -p 8787:8787 ghcr.io/nuno-agostinho/psichomics:latest
```

3. Go to RStudio Web via the web browser at https://localhost:8787
4. Log in RStudio with user `rstudio` and password `bioc`
5. Load psichomics using `library(psichomics)`
6. Start the visual interface of psichomics with `psichomics()`

## Tutorials

The following case studies and tutorials are available and were based on our 
[original article][article]:

* [Visual interface][tutorial-gui]
* [Command-line interface][tutorial-cli]
* [Loading user-provided data][tutorial-custom-data]
* [Preparing alternative splicing annotations][tutorial-prep-AS-annotation]

Another tutorial was published as part of the Methods in Molecular Biology book
series (the code for performing the analysis can be found [here][chapter-code]):

## Workflow

### Data input

Automatic retrieval and loading of pre-processed data from the following sources:

* [TCGA][] data of given tumours, including subject- and sample-associated
information, junction quantification and gene expression data
* [GTEx][] data of given tissues, including subject- and sample-associated
information, junction quantification and gene expression data
* [SRA][] data from select SRA projects via the [recount][] package

Other SRA, [VAST-TOOLS][] and user-provided data can also be manually loaded.
Please read [Loading user-provided data][tutorial-custom-data] for more
information.

#### Alternative splicing quantification

The quantification of each alternative splicing event is based on the proportion
of junction reads that support the inclusion isoform, known as percent 
spliced-in or PSI [(Wang *et al.*, 2008)][Wang2008].

An estimate of this value is obtained based on the the proportion of reads 
supporting the inclusion of an exon over the reads supporting both the inclusion
and exclusion of that exon. To measure this estimate, we require:

1. **Alternative splicing annotation**: human annotation is provided and custom
annotations can be prepared for use in psichomics.
2. Quantification of RNA-Seq reads aligning to exon-exon splice junctions
(**exon-exon junction quantification**), either user-provided or retrieved from
[TCGA][], [GTEx][] and [SRA][].

#### Gene expression processing

Gene expression can be normalised, filtered and log2-transformed in-app or
provided by the user.

### Data grouping

Molecular and clinical sample-associated attributes allow to establish groups 
that can be explored in data analyses.

For instance, [TCGA][] data can be analysed based on smoking history, gender and
race, among other attributes. Groups can also be manipulated (e.g. merged,
intersected, etc.), allowing for complex attribute combinations. Groups can also
be saved and loaded between different sessions.

### Data Analyses

* **Dimensionality reduction** via principal and independent component analysis
(PCA and ICA) on alternative splicing quantification and gene expression.

* **Differential splicing and gene expression analysis** based on variance and
median parametric and non-parametric statistical tests.

* **Correlation between gene expression and splicing quantification**, useful to
correlate the expression of a given event with the expression of RNA-binding
proteins, for instance.

* **Survival analysis** via Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models based on
sample-associated features. Additionally, we can study the impact of a splicing
event (based on its quantification) or a gene (based on its expression) on
patient survivability.

* **Gene, transcript and protein annotation**, including relevant research
articles.
