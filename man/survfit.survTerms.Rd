\usage{
\method{survfit}{survTerms}(survTerms, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{survTerms}{\code{survTerms} object: survival terms obtained after 
running \code{processSurvTerms} (see examples)}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to \code{survival::survdiff}
\describe{
  \item{subset}{
expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be used in
the fit.  This can be a logical vector (which is replicated to have
length equal to the number of observations), a numeric vector indicating
which observation numbers are to be included (or excluded if negative),
or a character vector of row names to be included.  All observations are
included by default.
}
  \item{na.action}{
a missing-data filter function.  This is applied to the \code{model.frame} after any
subset argument has been used.  Default is \code{options()$na.action}.
}
  \item{rho}{
a scalar parameter that controls the type of test.
}
  \item{timefix}{process times through the \code{aeqSurv} function to
  eliminate potential roundoff issues.}
}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{survfit} containing one or more survival curves.
}
\description{
Create survival curves
}
\details{
A survival curve is based on a tabulation of the number at risk and
  number of events at each unique death time.  When time is a floating
  point number the definition of "unique" is subject to interpretation.
  The code uses factor() to define the set.
  For further details see the documentation for the appropriate method, i.e.,
  \code{?survfit.formula} or \code{?survfit.coxph}.  

  A survfit object may contain a single curve, a set of curves, or a
  matrix curves.
  Predicted curves from a \code{coxph} model have one row for each
  stratum in the Cox model fit and one column for each specified
  covariate set.
  Curves from a multi-state model have one row for each stratum and
  a column for each state, the strata correspond to predictors on the
  right hand side of the equation.  The default printing and plotting
  order for curves is by column, as with other matrices.

  Curves can be subscripted using either a single or double subscript.
  If the set of curves is a matrix, as in the above, and one of the
  dimensions is 1 then the code allows a single subscript to be used.
  (That is, it is not quite as general as using a single subscript for
  a numeric matrix.)
